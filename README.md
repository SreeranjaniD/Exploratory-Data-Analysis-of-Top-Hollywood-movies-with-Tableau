I have with me the top 10 highest grossing films of the years 1975 to 2018- 44 years data. I hope to answer some important choices I would make if I were the CEO of a Studio in Hollywood.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

From the producers’ point of view, it is important to know which genre of films in Hollywood are making the most money. Observed that fantasy genre made the most money in the last 43 years. That too $36 billion! Comedy made more than $20 billion! I did not expect comedy to make that much.

Based on the genres making the most money, I wonder how IMDB rating relates to the top movies’ worldwide gross. As expected, the highest grossing movies are not high IMDB rating movies. The 7-7.4 IMDB rating movies have the highest worldwide gross.

As expected, the highest ranked film in a year has the highest IMDB rating.

It is interesting to note that films with length of 90-150 minutes have made at least 10 billion dollars more than others.

Length of the movies over the years have slightly increased their length. But I infer that we must look at least 20 movies per year’s data to confirm the increase.

Discovery: Avg worldwide gross has increased since 1975 till 2012 and has been crashing ever since. In 2018 the average worldwide gross of Hollywood is as much as it was in 2000.

The genre of movies from 2012 to 2018 have gone from Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Animation, Action to mainly Animation and Action genres. The film industry should concentrate on scripts which made more money in the past decades and make choices.

We see that Warner Bros, Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount are the top 3 studios in making the most money in films from 1975-2018

As expected the number of top grossing films studios DreamWorks, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer have not produced top films. Even top studios like 20th century Fox and Columbia Pictures are seldom giving hits in 2012 to 2018 than from 2000 to 2012.
